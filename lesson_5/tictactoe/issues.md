# Issues
- Game allows user to chose 1 human player and 0 computer players
- Game allows 0 players total
- Possibly move stuff like match length and win length to new object called "Rules"
- Possible move player list initialization to a Player class method
- If user selects max amount of humans, the program will ask for the amount of computer players even though the amount allowed is zero.
- Diagonals aren't registering correctly. The program is only finding diagonals from the corners.
- Minimum win length should be 3
