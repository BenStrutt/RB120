# OOP - The Object Model

- Class names are always *CamelCase*. Class file names are always *snake_case.rb*.

- A **module** is a collection of behaviors (methods) that is usable in other classes via **mixins**. (`include Module`).

- `include` is a method invocation.

- Ruby has a distinct method-lookup path for when a method is called on an object. This path can be viewed by calling `#ancestors` on an object.
